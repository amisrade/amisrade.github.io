    Travelers are often left stressed out and disorganized when planning a trip, So i developed an app that helps travelers make the most out of their trips by conveniently scheduling plans together and finding fun travel activities

            I created Dakota to be the User Persona, Since disorganized and busy people with an appetite to travel, like him, lack time management skills.         
        </p>
        <p>
            Making this User persona helped narrowing it down to what audience we need to tailor the PINPOINT app too.

            The Story board process involving Dakota, really helped creating a unique senerio, that would likely happen to most people.

        When I created the user flow for PinPoint, I got a better sense of how the on boarding process would look like.

        <p>
            With the user flow completed, I drew up a LoFi mock up of the on boarding process of the app. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Im a visual person so seeing this drawn up really helped with the design making of the app.

        Using Figma, I made a low fidelity prototype of the onboarding process. Its a very simple design but It takes care of bussiness. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I faced a learning curve since Figma was new to me at the time but It was worth the learning experience to get through with it

        Final Thoughts
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Pinpoint project was a good early project to help me get my feet wet into this field. I learned a lot through it. On the analytical side of this project, I was able be more immersed in the UX side of things which definitely was a plus.     </p>
