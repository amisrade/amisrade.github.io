        Women of the World is an Non-For-Profit that looks to empower and help women that have been forcibly displaced in society from every corner of the world. The site has a very columorful design that looks to show it’s multi-cultural design. At first glance, it does make it hard to take in the information - so our mission is to maintain that warmth and attract the eyes around the page but all the while allow for the information to be easily absorbed.

    <p>We created a Jacqueline Porter, to be our user persona. We picked her because she seems like the typical individual that would be closely involved with a non profit organization, like WoW. Creating her really helped me pinpoint what type of demographic/individuals would help towards the recreating and molding our redesigned website. </p>

            After conducting user interviews and collecting feedback, we grouped key points into categories. This made it more easier for us to determine what elements we need to focus and emphasize in our website redesign.         </p>

            Making a low fidelity protoype of the website, helped me get a basic idea and structure of the new website’s layout.

            It also made it easier and faster to develop these into high fidelity resolution

        <p>It was very fun getting to the style tile of this project. It made it easier to visualize the aesthetics looks of the new website.
            I believe I contributed a lot of my strengths into this portion of the project and more so to the HI FI protoype aswell. </p>

                We wanted to go for “skin tone” color scheme and minimalist look, that is inclusive to all members of the community. We thought it would be more pleasing and attention grabbing to go this route

            Tada! Website HiFi prototype is born.
            The original website was pretty text heavy, so our goal was to redesign it in a way so that users can stay engaged despite the text.
            
            It was a little tricky at first but we added a decent amount of interesting visual elements and broke down the text to more smaller bite size chunks.
        </p>
    <p>
        We received a lot of kudos for this project. When we did usability testing on it, Users we mainly very satisfied with this Redesign found it way user friendly than the original. 
Users also loved the clean attractive aesthetics to it.

        Final Thoughts
    </h2>
    <p>
        Throughout this project we were able to work as a team and redesign a non-profit website focused on empowering women from all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end we were able to create a prototype that reflects all of the information and data collected during this process. We were able to customize it based off of our research and user interviews and build off of that.
