        Women of the World is an Non-For-Profit that looks to empower and help women that have been forcibly displaced
        in society from every corner of the world. The site has a very colorful design that looks to show it’s
        multi-cultural design. At first glance, it does make it hard to take in the information - so our mission is to
        maintain that warmth and attract the eyes around the page but all the while allow for the information to be
        easily absorbed.
